title: Yelp Sentiment Analysis

<div id="wrap">

      <h2>{{ page.title }} </h2>
        <p>Sentiment analysis is often used by companies to quantify general social media opinion
          (for example, using tweets about several brands to compare customer satisfaction).
          One of the simplest and most common sentiment analysis methods is to classify words
          as “positive” or “negative”, then to average the values of each word to categorize
          the entire document.

        <p>In information theory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">entropy</a>
          is a measure of information and uncertainty. This analysis utilizes entropy as a measurement of the unpredictabiity of each league. Entropy is computed based on the probabilities of each outcome for every game based on the odds from bookmakers.
           The idea here is that if there are consistently large favourites in games throughout the season then the league is considered predictable and therefore uncompetitive.
        <br>
        <br>
          Entropy is at its minimum when one outcome has a probability of 1 <b>(H = 0, totally predictable)</b>.
          <br>
          Entropy is at its maximum when each outcome has an equal probability <b>(H = 1.098, totally unpredictable)</b>.
