        <p>Over the past few decades football has been criticised by many for being too
          predictable. The elite clubs in europe continue to increase their
          revenues year after year and thus can spend small fortunes on the best
          players of smaller clubs. This drastically reduces the competitveness of
          each domestic league making it less unpredictable and interesting to watch.
        </p>

        <p>In information theory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">entropy</a>
          is a measure of information and uncertainty. This analysis utilizes entropy as a measurement of the
          unpredictabiity of each league. It is computed based on the probabilities of each outcome for every game based on the odds from bookmakers.
           This measurement is averaged for each team and season.
        <br>
        <br>
          Entropy is at its minimum when one outcome has a probability of 1 <b>(H = 0, totally predictable)</b>.
          <br>
          Entropy is at its maximum when each outcome has an equal probability <b>(H = 1.098, totally unpredictable)</b>.

  <p>The data used in this visualization is taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/kernels">Kaggleâ€™s European
    Soccer database</a>, which spans across 8 years from 2008 to 2016. The data was
  processed and the entropy for each team and for each year was calculated in an ipython
     <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/kernels">ipython notebook</a>.
