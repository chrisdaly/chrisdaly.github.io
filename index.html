    	<p>My name is Chris Daly, I have a BEng in Civil Engineering and MSc in Cloud Computing. My goal with this website is to showcase some of the data science projects that I've been working on. Iâ€™m most interested in machine learning (python/sci-kit learn) and data visualization (d3). However, in an attempt to learn more about the underlying fundamentals of these technologies, I also try to create my own models and visualizations from scratch.</p>
